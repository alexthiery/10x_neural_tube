#
## Data availability
#
This repository contains the required code to run the entire alignment and downstream analysis pipeline. For those who would like to re-run the analysis, the following files should be downloaded:

- to run the analysis including the alignment, the raw fastq sequencing files can be found [here]().
- to run the downstream analysis from the UMI counts generated from 10x Genomics Cell Ranger are embedded can be found within the repository [here]("./alignmentOut/cellrangerCounts_renamed").

#
## Analysis pre-requisites
#
The pipeline is run using Nextflow and Docker to ensure reproducibility. The repository can be called directly from GitHub, so to re-run the analysis you just need to install [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).



If you are wanting to run the downstream analysis interactively outside of Nextflow, you still need to download Docker and you will also need to download this repository.

#
## Docker
#
Docker allows us to run our analysis through a container with all required libraries and dependencies. This ensures cross-platform reproducibility of our results.

The docker image used can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/alexthiery/10x_neural_tube)

We have also included Rstudio within our docker image to allow you to run the downstream analysis interactively if you wish - for details on how to do this click [here](#interactive-downstream-analysis).

#
## Nextflow
#
You can easily re-run our entire pipeline in Nextflow. For this
